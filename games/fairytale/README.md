(v1.9, 2011)

<blockquote>
<p>Magic has come to your domain. You knew you were taking a risk when you
opened the borders to those magic bean salesmen, but surely hiring the troll to
collect tolls on your new bridge was the right move? The old fortune teller who
came to your castle that fateful night said that your wishes would come true,
and now everything you touch is turning to gold, and your servants seem to have
been replaced by walking brooms with arms!<p>

<p>You scoffed when your advisers told you those old wizards were dangerous, but
now, with strange lights flashing over the nearby mountains at night, you can't
help but wonder if they were right. Will you hire a sorceress to cast spells at
your behest, or a huntsman to deal with those mysterious wolves that are
plaguing the countryside? Only by wit, courage, and a little hard-earned wisdom
will you be able to protect and expand your dominion.</p>

<p>Fairy Tale is a free, unofficial, print-and-play expansion for the game
Dominion. It adds 21 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, including 10 Actions, 2
Treasures, 3 Victory cards, 5 Durations and 1 Reaction. The central theme is
cards that do multiple things.</p>

<p>Fairy Tale was originally designed by D. Brad Talton, Jr. and after William Stewart offered to
help, he passed the project on to him and the BGG community.</p>
