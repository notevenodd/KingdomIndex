<blockquote>
<p>
"The word of God has spread throughout the realm, leading to the rise of the
church, and bringing peace and salvation to the faithful. Monks search their
souls for illumination, priests seek to teach the grace of God, and grand towers
and cathedrals are erected in his name.
</p><p>
But not all choose to follow in God's light - a host of heretics, pagans, and
cultists threatens to destroy the sanctity of the church, risking damnation for
their dark and sacrilegious ways. But who is truly without sin? The coffers of
the church swell from tithe and indulgence, crusaders war and plunder in the
name of God, while the inquisition silences their enemies in a wake of terror
and blood.
</p><p>
The choice is yours: join ranks with forces of God to spread his holy word, or
risk your eternal soul for unimagined power in this fan-made expansion to
Dominion!"
