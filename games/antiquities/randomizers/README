The Randomizer comes in three flavors:

AntiquitiesNoRen: Haven't got Renaissance yet? Me neither :( This will choose
from all sets (no Promos) and Antiquities.

AntiquitiesWithRen: You're luckier than me and have Renaissance! This will
choose from all published sets (no Promos) and Antiquities.

AntiquitiesConManMethod: This is the same as AntiquitiesWithRen but uses a
version of f.ds user ConMan's method to randomize the inclusion of Colonies,
Platinums, Shelters, and Boulder Traps.

The Randomizers are pretty basic. You have the source, so feel free to edit them
to add features! I'll probably start a thread on f.ds dedicated to explaining
how it works.
