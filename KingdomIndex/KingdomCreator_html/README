HTML pages which launch the tools from KingdomCreator
(with analytics, etc. removed)

THOSE NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN SYNC WITH KINGDOM CREATOR AND ANY
CHANGE THERE BREAK THOSE (SEE IN KINGDOMCREATOR, THE HTML PAGES
IN THE DOCS/ DIRECTORY). IF I'M FED UP DOING THIS, I MAY REMOVE
ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS AND THE DEPENCIES TO KINGDOM CREATOR.
